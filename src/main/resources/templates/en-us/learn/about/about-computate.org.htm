              Christopher runs computate.org, an open source software company providing advanced tools
              for building data-driven websites with OpenAPIs and fine-grained authorization standards, for
              the last 20 years. The sovereign artificial intelligence of Computate software automatically
              watches code for changes, parses the code and code comments, indexes the code in a search
              engine, then generates the code you need based on the comments in the code. The Smart
              Aquaculture use case built with Computate software has an index of the hundreds of FIWARE
              Smart Data Models to automatically write an IoT application for many domains including smart
              Cities, agri-food, water, environment, energy and more. Computate provides online developer
              workbenches for building these applications, and can teach software developers how to build
              these solutions from the beginning, all the way to the cloud or the edge. Working in this way is
              fun and easy to get started, because the containerized dependencies are all taken care of in the
              online workbench. Developers will see and debug their running application on the Web, and
              learn how to build custom dashboards for their data using modern web components.
